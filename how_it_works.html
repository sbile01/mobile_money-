	<h2>Why Mobile Money?</h2>
	In an increasingly cashless society, we see people who are left out of the loop. What about buskers? What about people selling things on the street?? We want to create an easy and cheap technological solution that will work for both the payer and the payee. By using QR codes, people with a smartphone can scan the QR code and not only give money to street performers or pay for magazines or newspapers, but can also learn more about them.

	<h2>Why QR codes?</h2>
	We were thinking of the challenges of bringing street performers and salespeople into the tech economy loop. Some people don't have access to a smartphone or an expensive portable card reader that also entails monthly costs and necessitates a power source. For someone who might be performing for 6 hours or someone selling The Big Issue all day, electricity will be an issue. 

	A QR code will not only allow those with no access to a power to be paid electronically, but can provide more background information on the recipient to the person scanning the QR code.

	By creating a profile once and having the ability to update it, a performer can have more control over what the user knows about them, possibly providing links to sell more music, or provide performance locations or dates. Anyone with a bank account can send or receive money.

	With this idea, we hope to be able to loop in the street performers and salespeople into the increasingly cashless society. We hope that you find it useful, both as sender and recipient!

	<h2>How do I pay people?</h2>
	When you see a busker who particpates in Mobile Money, they will have a printed QR code posted in an easily visible place. Scan the photo with your QR scanner app and it will link you to the busker's page that they have created. You will then have the option to enter the amount that you would like to give them from their suggested amounts or enter your own amount. Tap enter to pay them and the money will be transfered to their Mobile Money account. 

	<h2>How do I get paid?</h2>
	All you have to do is go to our website, www.mobilemoney.com to create your own profile and enter your card details in order to receive payments. You can create a profile or even link your own existing website to our database for users to see when they scan your specific code. When you have completed these, a QR code will be generated for you to display when you are performing for people to scan.
